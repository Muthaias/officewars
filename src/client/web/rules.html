      <h1>Rules of the game</h1>
      <h2>What happens in the graph stays in the graph</h2>
      <p>
	This is the most important rule of the game. This is a game of social manipulation and cunning, ment to played among people who know and care for each other. You are allowed, encouraged even, to trick and deceive each other within the game, and also to seek retribution within the game if and when you have been tricked or lied to. You are not, however, allowed to seek retribution in any form outside of the game. If you do, then that makes you childish and means you are not mature enough to play games with adults. If you cannot handle this, then please do not play.
      </p>
      <h2>How to play</h2>
      <p>
	Every round is 12 hours long and begins/ends at 12:50 and 0:50 respectively (server local time). This means that actively playing the game a few minutes before and a few minutes after 12:50 (the end of your lunch brake?) makes you active in every round.<br/>

	The round consists of each player giving orders to their units, which will be carried out when the game ticks at the end of the round. During the round you also get to make deals with the other players, to try to get them to help you along. The social part of the game takes place outside of the game (chat, email, what have you). This means the game only works if you play with people you know and can talk to outside of the game.

	Each round, each of your units can take one of following actions:
	<ol>
	  <li>Stay and the defend the system it is in (the default action).</li>
	  <li>Move to any other system you control, provided that you control an unbroken chain of systems in between them.</li>
	  <li>Attack another system to which it is directly connected.</li>
	  <li>Support another unit in a directly connected system (either in defence or in attack). You can support other players units, not only your own!</li>
	</ol>
      </p>
      <h2>The tick</h2>
      <p>
	At the end of each round, the game will "tick", meaning everybodys orders are carried out and a new round begins.
	
	The tick will resolve in the following way:
	
	<ol>
	  <li>Movement:
	    All units that have been ordered to move to another system controlled by the same player will do so, provided the target system is not already occupied (there can only be zero or one units in each system at any one time).</li>
	  
	  <li>Pinning:
	    A unit is considered pinned for the round if it is attacked. A pinned unit can still attack, but cannot support other units. Use this to your advantage to cut support to systems you want to conquer!<br/></li>

	  <li>Battle:
	    When a unit is ordered to attack a system belonging to another player, the strength of each side is calculated. Attackers begin at strength 1, as do defenders unless they are also ordered to attack another system, in which case they defend with a strength of 0. There is one point of strength added for every unit that supports either the attacker or the defender respectively. If the attacker has greater strength than the defender, the system is conquered and the defending unit is lost. If the defender has equal or greater strength than the attacker, nothing happens. If a system is attacked from several systems at once, only the strongest attack is considered. If there are several attackers of equal strength, then they block each other and nothing happens, even if that strength is greater than the strength of the defence. Supporting units are never lost.</li>

	  <li>Deployment:
	    At the end of each round a new unit will spawn orbiting you home world, if:
	    <ol>
	      <li>You are in control of your home world.</li>
	      <li>There isn't a unit in orbit already.</li>
	      <li>The number of units under you control does not already exceed 3 + (number of systems you control / 2).</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  
	</ol>
	
      </p>
      <h2>Winning</h2>
      <p>
	Playing the game until only a single player remains can be tiresome (you can do that if you want). But in order to stop the game before it gets boring, there is a voting mechanism to end the game early by electing a winner. When the player with the most systems control more than 20% more systems than the one in second place, it becomes possible for the other players to vote to end the game and collectively surrender. Votes are wheighted by the number of systems each player control. If the vote carries, the player with the most systems win the game.
